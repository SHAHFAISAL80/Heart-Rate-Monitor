monitoring heart rate in real-time using a webcam.This is based on an algorithm called Eulerian Video Magnification which makes it possible to see the colours of the face change as blood rushes in and out of the head. It is able to detect the pulses and calculates the heart rate in beats per minute (BPM).This method performs well in real-time.
